## Live Demo

**Visit [divscout.app](https://divscout.app)** to see DivScout in action!

The web interface provides:
- üìä **Dashboard** with dividend statistics overview
- üè¢ **Company browser** with sector and industry filtering
- üìÖ **Payment calendar** showing upcoming dividends
- üìà **Dividend histories** with confidence scores
- üîç **High-confidence data** (‚â•0.8 confidence threshold)

**Current dataset**: 4,643 verified dividend records across 109 companies with 100% confidence scoring (all low-confidence entries removed).

**Tech stack**: Flask API + Vanilla JavaScript frontend hosted on Namecheap Stellar with PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean.

**Repository**: [github.com/chonito7919/divscout-web](https://github.com/chonito7919/divscout-web)

## What It Does

DivScout automatically:

1. **Fetches XBRL data** from the SEC's CompanyFacts API for specified stock tickers
2. **Parses dividend information** from standardized XBRL tags in company financial statements
3. **Applies data quality checks** including:
   - Detection and filtering of annual totals (which are often reported alongside quarterly dividends)
   - Statistical outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR)
   - Duplicate removal based on ex-dividend dates
   - Confidence scoring (0.0 to 1.0) for each dividend entry
4. **Stores structured data** in a PostgreSQL database with full audit trails
5. **Flags low-confidence entries** for manual review (confidence < 80%)

## What It Does NOT Do

- ‚ùå **Does not provide real-time data** - XBRL data reflects filed reports, which lag behind announcements
- ‚ùå **Does not scrape HTML** - uses only official SEC JSON APIs
- ‚ùå **Does not predict future dividends** - only historical data
- ‚ùå **Does not validate data accuracy** - automated quality checks are heuristic, not definitive
- ‚ùå **Does not handle special dividends comprehensively** - focuses on regular cash dividends
- ‚ùå **Does not track dividend reinvestment programs (DRIPs)**
- ‚ùå **Does not process stock dividends or splits**
- ‚ùå **Does not support all companies** - limited to those with XBRL data and known CIKs

## Known Limitations

### Ticker Coverage
- **111+ tickers** are hardcoded in the CIK lookup function across all major sectors:
  - Technology (14 companies): AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, CSCO, ORCL, IBM, INTC, TXN, QCOM, ADI, etc.
  - Healthcare (10 companies): JNJ, UNH, LLY, ABBV, MRK, TMO, ABT, PFE, AMGN, CVS
  - Financials (15 companies): JPM, BAC, WFC, MS, GS, BLK, C, USB, PNC, V, MA, etc.
  - Consumer Staples (14 companies): KO, PEP, PG, WMT, COST, PM, MO, CL, KMB, GIS, etc.
  - Consumer Discretionary (10 companies): HD, MCD, NKE, SBUX, TGT, LOW, F, GM, etc.
  - Energy (10 companies): XOM, CVX, COP, SLB, EOG, PSX, VLO, OXY, KMI, WMB
  - Industrials (10 companies): BA, CAT, GE, LMT, RTX, UNP, HON, UPS, DE, MMM
  - Utilities (9 companies): NEE, DUK, SO, D, AEP, EXC, SRE, XEL, PCG
  - REITs (10 companies): O, AMT, PLD, CCI, EQIX, PSA, WELL, DLR, SPG, AVB
  - Materials (6 companies): LIN, APD, SHW, FCX, NEM, ECL
  - Telecom (3 companies): T, VZ, TMUS
- For other companies, you must manually find the CIK and add to `sec_edgar_client.py`
- The SEC's `company_tickers.json` endpoint is sometimes unavailable

### Data Completeness
- **Declaration dates**, **record dates**, and **payment dates** are **NOT available** in XBRL CompanyFacts API
  - The API only provides period start/end dates for financial reporting
  - Ex-dividend dates are approximated from period end dates
  - To get these dates, you would need to parse 8-K filings separately
- Some companies do not file complete XBRL dividend data
- XBRL format and tag usage varies by company

### Date Accuracy
- XBRL data typically provides period end dates, which are mapped to ex-dividend dates
- These may not perfectly match actual ex-dividend dates
- Always verify critical dates from official company sources

### Annual Total Detection
- While the tool attempts to filter out annual totals, some may slip through
- Conversely, some legitimate dividends might be incorrectly flagged
- Review all low-confidence entries manually

### Performance
- SEC enforces 10 requests/second rate limiting
- Processing large numbers of companies takes time
- No caching mechanism for API responses

## Data Quality & Confidence Scoring

Each dividend receives a confidence score based on multiple factors:

**Confidence Penalties Applied For:**
- Amount > $50.00 (very high): √ó0.5
- Amount < $0.01 (very low): √ó0.7
- Amount > 3√ó median: √ó0.6
- Amount > 2√ó median: √ó0.8
- Period duration ‚âà 365 days (annual): √ó0.3
- Period duration ‚âà 180 days (semi-annual): √ó0.5
- Missing fiscal period metadata: √ó0.9
- From 10-K filing without quarter info: √ó0.8

**Dividends with confidence < 0.8 are flagged for manual review.**

### Test Results

The tool has been tested against real SEC XBRL data with the following results:

#### ‚úÖ Production Database Statistics

**As of October 2025:**
- **Companies**: 109 companies across all major sectors
- **Total dividends extracted**: 4,909 dividend records
- **Clean data**: 4,643 verified dividends (94.6% after quality filtering)
- **Annual totals filtered**: 64 cumulative totals removed
- **Low confidence removed**: 202 dividends with confidence < 0.8 deleted
- **Date range**: Historical data from 2008-2025 depending on company

## Architecture

The tool follows a simple pipeline:

1. **Ticker ‚Üí CIK Lookup**: Convert stock ticker to SEC Central Index Key
2. **Fetch XBRL Data**: Retrieve company facts from SEC API
3. **Parse Dividends**: Extract dividend data using XBRL parser with quality checks
4. **Database Storage**: Store with confidence scores and audit trails
5. **Review Workflow**: Flag low-confidence entries for manual verification

### Key Components

- **`main.py`**: Entry point and pipeline orchestration
- **`sec_edgar_client.py`**: SEC API wrapper with rate limiting
- **`parsers/xbrl_dividend_parser.py`**: XBRL parsing and quality analysis
- **`db_connection.py`**: PostgreSQL interface and admin functions
- **`config.py`**: Configuration management
- **`admin/`**: Database administration utilities

## Data Sources

All data is sourced from:
- **SEC EDGAR CompanyFacts API**: https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/
- **SEC EDGAR Submissions API**: https://data.sec.gov/submissions/

This tool does **NOT**:
- Scrape HTML pages
- Use unofficial APIs or data sources
- Cache or redistribute SEC data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"SEC API returned 403 Forbidden"**
- Make sure `SEC_USER_AGENT` is set in your `.env` file
- Format must be: `YourName your.email@domain.com`
- The SEC blocks requests without proper identification

**"Ticker not found" or "Unknown ticker"**
- Only a limited set of tickers are hardcoded in `sec_edgar_client.py`
- Find the company's CIK manually at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch
- Modify the `lookup_ticker_to_cik()` function to add your ticker

**"Database connection failed"**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `systemctl status postgresql` or `brew services list`
- Check `.env` file has correct DB credentials
- Test connection: `psql -U your_user -d your_database`
- For SSL errors, try `DB_SSLMODE=disable` (not recommended for production)

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- SEC enforces 10 requests/second
- The client handles this automatically with rate limiting
- If you see this error, wait 60 seconds and try again
- Don't make direct `requests.get()` calls - always use `SECAPIClient`

**"No dividends found for [ticker]"**
- Not all companies report dividends in XBRL format
- Some companies don't pay dividends
- Try a known dividend payer first (AAPL, JNJ, KO) to verify setup
- Check if the company actually pays dividends on their investor relations page

**"Too many annual totals detected"**
- Some companies report cumulative amounts in their filings
- The parser attempts to filter these automatically
- Review flagged entries: `python admin/admin_stats.py --company TICKER`
- Manual review: use `db.get_dividends_for_review()`

**"Low confidence scores on valid dividends"**
- Confidence scoring is heuristic-based, not perfect
- Review flagged entries and approve if valid
- Adjust thresholds in `parsers/xbrl_dividend_parser.py` if needed
- Some edge cases (special dividends, stock dividends) may score low

**"Tests failing"**
- Ensure database is set up: `psql -U your_user -d your_database -f schema.sql`
- Check `.env` file exists and has all required variables
- Verify internet connection (tests fetch live SEC data)
- Some tests may fail if SEC API is temporarily unavailable
